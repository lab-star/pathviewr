## Introduction

  Studies of visually guided locomotion in birds, insects or even humans during often involve data gathered from motion capture technologies such as Optitrack's [(Motive)](https://optitrack.com/software/motive/), or the Straw Lab's [(Flydra)](https://github.com/strawlab/flydra). For these experiments, it is important to understand how visual stimuli influence behaviour. While is it not possible to measure how subjects directly perceive visual stimuli, it is possible to use the same motion capture data to calculate estimates of stimulus properties as they are perceived by the subject. With the tools available in pathviewR, researchers in ethology or psychology can provide analyses of both stimulus and response under natural locomotor conditions. 
  *Inherent to estimations of visual perceptions, we make several assumptions, which will be discussed below. We welcome suggestions and aim to address any assumptions that limit the accuracy of these estimates*. 
  To bridge the gap between objective measures of subject position and estimates of subjective stimulus perception, we can begin by calculating the angle a visual pattern subtends on the subject's retina - the visual angle. 
  Visual angles can be calculated provided there is information about the physical size of the pattern  and its distance from the subject's retina. Because researchers can control or measure the size of a  pattern, and we can calculate the distance between the subject and pattern using motion capture data, we can further calculate the visual angle produced by any pattern in the visual scene. Therefore, we first need to calculate the distance to the pattern. *Currently, we assume the subject's gaze is directly frontal or lateral to the face, in effect estimating image properties at a point in the frontal and lateral fields of view, respectively*. 
  

## Loading packages
  To begin, let's load `pathviewR` as well as `tidyverse`.

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pathviewR)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
```


## Data preparation
Data objects must be prepared as described in [the Data Import and Cleaning vignette](https://vbaliga.github.io/pathviewR/articles/data-import-cleaning.html) pipeline prior to their use with these functions. For a detailed description of the importing and cleaning functions, and when to use them, please see the linked vignette. 

Let's work with a few example datasets included in `pathviewR`. `pathviewR_motive_example_data.csv` is a .csv file exported from `Motive`. `pathviewR_flydra_example_data.mat` is a .mat file exported from `Flydra`. For more coarse-grained data cleaning tasks, `pathviewR` contains an all-in-one cleaning function `clean_viewr`. We will use this function for the following examples. 


```{r}
## Import motive data set
motive_data <- # import
  read_motive_csv(
    system.file("extdata", "pathviewR_motive_example_data.csv",
                package = 'pathviewR')
  )

## Clean motive data set
motive_full <-
  motive_data %>%
  clean_viewr(
    relabel_viewr_axes = TRUE,
    gather_tunnel_data = TRUE,
    trim_tunnel_outliers = TRUE,
    standardization_option = "rotate_tunnel",
    select_x_percent = TRUE,
    desired_percent = 50,
    rename_viewr_characters = FALSE,
    separate_trajectories = TRUE,
    max_frame_gap = "autodetect",
    get_full_trajectories = TRUE,
    span = 0.95
  )
```
```{r}
## Import flydra data set
flydra_data <- 
  read_flydra_mat(
    system.file("extdata", "pathviewR_flydra_example_data.mat",
                package = 'pathviewR'),
    subject_name = "birdie_wooster")

## Clean flydra data set
flydra_full <- 
  flydra_data %>%
  clean_viewr(
    relabel_viewr_axes = FALSE,
    gather_tunnel_data = FALSE,
    trim_tunnel_outliers = FALSE,
    standardization_option = "redefine_tunnel_center",
    length_method = "middle",
    height_method = "user-defined",
    height_zero = 1.44,
    get_velocity = FALSE,
    select_x_percent = TRUE,
    rename_viewr_characters = FALSE,
    separate_trajectories = TRUE,
    get_full_trajectories = TRUE
  )
```

## Add experiment information with `insert_treatments()`
Now that our objects have been cleaned, we must use `insert_treatments()` to add information about the experiments, including relevant properties of the visual stimulus and experimental tunnel that are necessary for calculating visual angles.
*`pathviewR` currently supports rectangular (box) or v-shaped experimental tunnels, though we are intrigued to include additional tunnel configurations*

#### V-shaped tunnel example
The data within `motive_full` were collected from birds flying through a 3m long v-shaped tunnel in which the height of the origin `(0,0,0)` was set to the height of the perches that were 0.3855m above the vertex, which was angled at 90Ëš. The visual stimuli on the positive and negative walls of the tunnel (where `position_width` values > 0 and < 0, respectively) were stationary dot-fields. Each dot was of size 0.05m in diameter. The visual stimuli on the positive and negative end walls of the tunnel (where `position_length` > 0 and < 0, respectively) were dot fields with dots 0.1m in diameter. This treatment was referred to as `"latB"`. 

Therefore we will use the following code:
```{r}
motive_treatments <- 
  motive_full %>% 
  insert_treatments(tunnel_config = "v",
                    perch_2_vertex = 0.3855,
                    vertex_angle = 90,
                    tunnel_length = 3,
                    stim_param_lat_pos = 0.05,
                    stim_param_lat_neg = 0.05,
                    stim_param_end_pos = 0.1,
                    stim_param_end_neg = 0.1,
                    treatment = "latB")

names(motive_treatments)
```
`motive_treatments` now has the variables `tunnel_config`, `perch_2_vertex`, `vertex_angle`, `stim_param_lat_pos`, `stim_param_lat_neg`, `stim_param_end_pos`, and `stim_param_end_neg` which are needed to calculate visual angles. The variable `treatment` has also been included and all of this information has been stored in the object's metadata.


#### Box-shaped tunnel example
The data within `flydra_full` were collected from birds flying in a 1 x 3m rectangular tunnel (a box). The visual stimuli were the same as in the motive example. 
```{r}
flydra_treatments <-
  flydra_full %>%
  insert_treatments(tunnel_config = "box",
                    tunnel_width = 1,
                    tunnel_length = 2,
                    stim_param_lat_pos = 0.05,
                    stim_param_lat_neg = 0.05,
                    stim_param_end_pos = 0.1,
                    stim_param_end_neg = 0.1,
                    treatment = "latB")

names(flydra_treatments)
```
`flydra_treatments` similarly has the variables `tunnel_config`, `tunnel_width`, `tunnel_length`, `stim_param_lat_pos`, `stim_param_lat_neg`, `stim_param_end_pos`, `stim_param_end_neg` and `treatment`.

## Calculating visual angles
#### Start by calculating the minimum distances to visual stimuli 

To estimate the visual angles perceived by the subject is it moves through the tunnel, we first need to calculate the distance between the subject and the visual stimuli. For this, we will use `calc_min_dist_v` or `calc_min_dist_box` depending on the configuration of the experimental tunnel.  
For v-shaped tunnels, several internal calculations are required and can be added to the output object with `simplify_output = FALSE`. Otherwise, the minimum distance are computed to the lateral walls and the end wall to which the subject is facing.

```{r motive_min_dist_pos, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
motive_min_dist <- 
  motive_treatments %>% 
  calc_min_dist_v(simplify_output = FALSE)

## Display minimum distances to the positive lateral walls
motive_min_dist %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = position_width, y = position_height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = min_dist_pos), size = 2) +
  coord_fixed() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # positive wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = 0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # negative wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = -0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014))
```

```{r flydra_min_dist_end, fig.height=4, fig.width=7}
flydra_min_dist <- 
  flydra_treatments %>% 
  calc_min_dist_box()

## Display minimum distances to the end walls
flydra_min_dist %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = position_length, y = position_width)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = min_dist_end), size = 2) +
  coord_fixed() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1,         # negative wall
                   y = -0.5,
                   xend = 1,
                   yend = -0.5)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1,         # positive wall
                   y = 0.5,
                   xend = 1,
                   yend = 0.5))
```


#### Now get visual angles 

```{r motive_vis_angle_pos}
motive_vis_angle <- 
  motive_min_dist %>% 
  get_vis_angle()

## visualize the angles produced from stimuli on the positive wall
motive_vis_angle %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = position_width, y = position_height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = vis_angle_pos_deg), size = 2, shape = 1) +
  coord_fixed()+
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # positive wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = 0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # negative wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = -0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014))
```

```{r}
flydra_vis_angle <- 
  flydra_min_dist %>% 
  get_vis_angle()

## visualize the angles produced by stimuli on the end walls
flydra_vis_angle %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = position_length, y = position_width)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = vis_angle_end_deg), size = 2) +
  coord_fixed() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1,        # negative wall
                   y = -0.5,
                   xend = 1,
                   yend = -0.5)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1,        # positive wall
                   y = 0.5,
                   xend = 1,
                   yend = 0.5))
```


The spatial frequency of the image of a visual stimulus refers to the size of the stimulus in visual space. It's often reported as the number of cycles of a visual pattern per 1Ëš of the visual field (cycles/degree). For a given distance from the subject, an image of a larger visual pattern produces a smaller spatial frequency, whereas an image of a smaller visual pattern produces a higher spatial frequency. 


## Calculating spatial frequency
To calculate the spatial frequency of the visual stimuli as perceived by the
subject some distance from the stimuli, we will use `get_sf()`. 

```{r}
motive_sf <- 
  motive_vis_angle %>%
  get_sf()

## visualize the spatial frequency of the stimulus on the positive wall 
motive_sf %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = position_width, y = position_height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sf_pos), size = 2, shape = 1) +
  coord_fixed()+
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # positive wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = 0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # negative wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = -0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014))
```

```{r}
flydra_sf <- 
  flydra_vis_angle %>% 
  get_sf()

## visualize the spatial frequency of the stimulus on the end walls
flydra_sf %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = position_length, y = position_width)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sf_end), size = 2) +
  coord_fixed() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1,        # negative wall
                   y = -0.5,
                   xend = 1,
                   yend = -0.5)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -1,        # positive wall
                   y = 0.5,
                   xend = 1,
                   yend = 0.5))
```
